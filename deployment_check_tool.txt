## The Datera Deployment Check Tool (DDCT) ##
#############################################

-------
Purpose
-------
This tool is designed to be run on customer systems as an easy way to determine
if they are currently configured correctly (by the standards of the tool) for
starting a set of PoC tests.

Once the set of checks has been run a report file will be generated.  This
report file can then be fed back into the tool to have it try and fix each
encountered problem.

------
Checks
------

* ARP
* IRQ
* CPU Frequency
* Block Devices
* Multipath
* Cinder Volume Driver

-------------
Future Checks
-------------

* Cinder Backup Driver
* Glance Image Backend Driver
* Nova Ephemeral Driver
* Docker Driver
* Kubernetes Driver

-----
Usage
-----

To perform basic readiness checks:
$ ./ddct

This will create a file ddct-$hostname-report-$timestamp.tx
So for example, a host tlx200 will generate a report
ddct-tlx200-report-1516126441.txt

The report will have the following format:

CHECK_1: Success
CHECK_2: FAIL -- reason
CHECK_3: FAIL -- reason
CHECK_4: Success

An example output would be:

OS: Success
ARP: Success
IRQ: Failure -- irqbalance is active
VIP_1_PING: Failure -- could not ping 10.1.2.41
